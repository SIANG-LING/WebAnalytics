      "['I would like to mention Rommel Gopez. I have stayed at Hotel Edison before, but it was quite a few years ago. Rommel was so helpful in advising our group prior to and during our visit. In this age of Covid, it was such a relief to feel both safe and welcome.I will be sure to recommend Hotel Edison to all my friends.', 'This was our 2nd stay at The Edison and we will be sure to have a 3rd. The signature room we stayed in was clean and comfortable and the staff are always polite and helpful. The hotel is literally just one minute walk to Times Square and the best bar in New York, The Rum House, is situated in the lobby. The Mai Tai’s there are fantastic! Can’t wait to go again.', 'Our group of friends enjoyed our recent visit to NYC.  Staying at the Hotel Edison makes it so easy to go to the Broadway shows we were looking forward to.  You cannot beat the location!  The staff is incredible.  From the very helpful concierge to the room service personnel, and, of course, to our friend Rommel, the staff at the Edison is quite simply the best!  We are already looking forward to our next stay…', 'The staff at Hotel Edison were amazing, from the front desk to housekeeping.  We want to give a special shout out to Justina, Tex, Jennifer and Marcos for their kindness and hospitality.  Luidin, Manager, was exceptionally nice as well.  I cannot say enough about the staff at the hotel.  The rooms were nice and with queen beds which are hard to find in NYC.  I recommend this hotel if you want to stay near Times Square.', 'Big shout out from 4 ladies from Virginia!  Grisselle, Erick ,and Danny do an excellent job. They were a pleasure to be around every day. Their customer service and warm personalities made the trip so much more enjoyable than any other place. A very safe environment in a great location.', 'Stayed for 5 days, the location was great. The room was very clean and cleaned daily. They offer a coupon gives  two options either sit down breakfast at Friedman’s or to go breakfast sandwich at 45 The Bond, both were delicious.Justina at the front desk went out of her way to help us, making sure we had everything we needed. It was a great vacation!', 'Look no further for an amazing hotel. Right beside Time Square, the hotel is on the doorstep to everything.  From shops, food and transport. The subway is just a small walk away which made it easy for commuting to JFK. The in hotel bars/restaurants were great. Food was lovely. Personal preference was that Bond 45 was nicer food but still food was great.The staff…couldn’t do anything more for you. They were all so helpful and friendly. The guest relations manager Rommel was so so so nice! He made us feel extremely welcomed and even organized a surprise gift for my wife given the trip was for her birthday.  They even offer a shuttle service to the airports which is handy…especially with heavy suitcases after shopping. The security team were fantastic too, always in watch and checked that only guests weee accessing the hotel which made us feel that bit extra secure. Will definitely be back and have so many great memories!! Thanks again everyone at the hotel.', 'I have been to NYC 26 times in 25 years; I have stayed at the Edison 22 times.  I love the character of this hotel, the location, the upgrades in recent years and I love the PEOPLE!    Dining venues onsite offer great options and dining times.  I have stayed in my own and with travel groups I bring yearly.', 'My girlfriends and I enjoyed a wonderful visit to the Big Apple and our stay at the Hotel Edison was the best.  You can’t find a better spot located steps from almost every Broadway show and Times Square. Breakfast was great in both restaurants and we were greeted in the morning by Rommel the guest relations manager. Felt very welcome.  Our rooms were all well supplied and not only comfortable but lovely.  Staff at this hotel all made our trip such a pleasure    We’ll be back in the spring !! Thanks to all', \"It's the little things that make all the difference and I can't praise the Hotel Edison concierge members, Jorge and Gio, enough for taking the time to not only help me but make a fun memory for our trip. After a day walking around the city, I realized the pockets on my new wool coat were sewn shut. I asked the concierge if they had some scissors I could use and they not only provided, but Jorge used his knife to cut my seams while Gio held the flashlight! Their kindness is something I will always remember about Hotel Edison and my trip to NYC.\", 'We stayed for 5 nights over Thanksgiving week. The sit down breakfast is worth the small wait and the grab and go breakfast is perfect. The room was clean and housekeeping came every day. We felt safe in the hotel and the short walk to the Richard Rodgers theater was amazing. Definitely recommend and we would stay there again. All the staff we encountered where very helpful and friendly.', 'I was extremely pleased with this hotel and staff. The hotel is steps away from Time Square! Makes it super easy for shopping! They have great restaurants attached to the hotel plus breakfast was delicious! Latoya was my go to girl if I needed anything! I highly recommend this beautiful and historic landmark!', 'Although the room is small, it was very comfortable. I loved the Streetwise walking tour near the Evelyn hotel that was complimentary. I plan to do one with each stay. The location is wonderful! I went to the theatre 4 times in 3 days! The breakfast at Bond 45 was delish! Always my “go to” hotel in NYC.', 'The Hotel Edison has been our base when visiting New York for theater visits for some 20 years.  We were FINALLY able to return after two years away this past Thanksgiving weekend -- theater is back, and so is New York!It was like returning home.  Many of the longtime staff who make the place are still here, and as has long been true, the room was immaculate, spacious by New York standards (spend the extra money to get a Signature room), and very well appointed.  Of special note, Rommel Gopez, the Guest Relations Manager, always does an outstanding job of making sure that everything is right.  He is a terrific asset for the Edison; if you have any needs or issues, ask him and he will make it right.We were delighted to be back, and hope to be back in April.  It will remain our New York home!', 'We have been staying at this hotel for decades and it has greatly improved the facility over that time. The rooms are very well appointed and the staff is wonderful. Rommel Gopez always goes the extra step to make our trip memorable. The fitness room has taken out some equipment in order to do more distancing during the pandemic. Highly recommend this hotel.', \"Staying at the Hotel Edison is like a trip back home. Located a block off Times Square, in the heart of the Theater district, it's easy walk to many events.It is a busy time to be back in the city, but the Edison is braced for any event. Always with a gracious staff, this luxury hotel harkens back to an earlier time and has kept its flair of Art Deco charm. The newly restored rooms are comfortable, cozy and delightful. The main salon is a great place to meet, flanked by two restaurants with great servers to keep you fed and the Rum Bar, to keep you entertained. There is a luggage check and valet service, or the handsome doormen will hail a cab for you.I never stay anywhere else.The Edison is my place to stay in NYC!\", 'Excellent stay at The Edison. No issues with checking in or checking out. Room was clean and breakfast was delish at Bond 54!  Excellent customer service from all those who we interacted with. You are in the heart of Time Square so you can’t go wrong with The Edison.', 'Right in Times Square within walking distance of everything. We had a two bedroom suite with one king and 2 queen size beds.  Lots of space for a family of 5….4 teenage ladies and senior.  Rooms were clean with good amenities. Great value', '2nd time we have stayed last time 10 yrs ago . Fab location and excellent hotel . 2 min from time square . All staff so helpful and security excellent you are checked you are staying in hotel before you get to the lifts . Rooms are spotless and cleaned with fresh towels every day . Yes our bath room needed  updated but perfectly clean . We had breakfast each day excellent choices . Used concierge to book hotel airport shuttle, Woodbury common, hop on hop off bus , so helpful. Rum house bar was our night cap excellent live music', 'There are a few things lacking due to the age of the structure and the location of the hotel. But that is also it’s strong point, being a stones throw from Times Sauare, etc.The staff is always striving to be helpful and courteous and this is a strong point. The hotel and our rooms were clean and well kept. The restaurants and bars are a great NYC experience!', 'This is my favorite hotel in Manhattan.  Great for business or leisure. It is in the absolute best location (located in the middle of Times Square)  with the friendliest staff and very nice rooms. I would highly recommend..', 'Came on a Mother/Daughter trip and had an amazing time.  Hotel was easy to find and so very close to Times Square.  Room was clean, beds were nice and comfy, air/heat made noises at night but, it was ok because we were so tired every night.  Staff was so nice, Marco made sure we were pleased with our room.  I really liked that you have to show your room card to get past the elevator guy.  We felt safe the entire time.  NYPD is on every corner and gladly helped us with directions and which Subway we needed to get on.  We had an amazing time and Hotel Edison was part of it.', 'Stayed here for a quick wedding and it was everything I needed it to be and more. The staff was beyond friendly, the hotel was clean and incredibly pleasant, and the room was perfect. Special shout-out to Rommel Gopez for his incredible kindness and amazing sense of humor!!', 'Room was small (even though it was the deluxe room) but everything we needed, it was cleaned daily and fresh towels daily which was great, bathroom door was clear so no point in even having one. They took $500 as a deposit on arrival, which they advise you will get back up to a month after your stay. Breakfast was awful, eggs of anytype and an orange or hot drink, if u want anything else you had to pay. We paid $30 one morning for 2x drinks of orange and 2x sets of bacon. Really good location.', 'I would particularly like to highlight the great support from Mrs.Jahai da Escotto, sec. supervisor from the hotel. I lost my laptop bag and she did such a great job - and gave me a perfect support and help me get it back! Thanks to her, it was possible to getthe laptop back in a city as big as new york!', 'I was in Edison Hotel in November 2021. Very good location, about 100m from Times Square. Excellent and professional service by Justina from helpdesk. My favourite hotel in NY. See you next time NY :)', 'Hotel managers Scott and Danny treated us like family! Seriously, just imagine being greeted with enthusiasm every time you walk through the hotel lobby. The staff at the Edison really care about their guests. And, breakfast is included either in one of two restaurants on site, or as a “grab and go”.', \"Check in reception was ok, but, all down hill from there, room was tiny, old, wall paper falling off walls, heat would not work, dimly lit with absolutely NO Ammenities in room. Room does not appear to have been updated since it was built in 1931, still probably has same mattress from 1931 too. Mattress was soft and had a big dip in it showing its wear.Tried calling front desk to report, no one would answer the phone,  was on 19th floor could easily hear street noises, sirens all night long. Mattress was old and in need of replacement. They charged $350/night for this dump.They charge an additional fee as deposit of about $350, like someone in their right mind would actually want to steal any of the old crap from the room.Once they get your credit card number, they're done servicing you.\", 'Charred bacon beyond taste. Cold potatoes. Barely warm eggs. Did not get toast. Server never checked back. Coffee warming not offered. This is a very busy place to eat. It’s difficult to figure out the waiting area as Edison Hotel has access as well as patrons  from 47th St entrance. My breakfast partner’s meal was satisfactory. Floor manager knew what to say and corrected my complaint.', \"Just got back from a great trip to NYC. Hotel is situated right off Times Square in the theatre district. Several subway lines are just a couple streets (the short blocks) away, and restaurant row is one street and one avenue away.It's a cool old art deco hotel that has been really nicely remodeled. The rooms are clean and stylish, and the elevators are fast - I never had to wait more than 20 seconds, and often there was one waiting when I pushed the button. Plenty of hot water, plenty of water pressure, nice bath towels. Bed and pillows were comfortable. There's security at the door and in the lobby.Really, I could not have asked for a nicer stay. Will definitely stay here again.\", \"The hotel was a good price, clean and comfortable.  Staff was attentive and security good. The bathroom was newly updated with plenty of room. The furniture could  use an update. Don't miss Vince Giordano and the Nighthawks who play downstairs at Bond 45  on Mondays and Tuesdays for a trip to the 1920's and 30's.\", 'My daughter and I were in town for the 15th Anniversary of Spring Awakening concert. I booked this hotel because of its proximity to the theater and because it was a nice hotel for the price. I had stayed there a few years ago. The hotel is even better now! Friendly staff, comfy bed and clean room, and breakfast included in the great price! I have stayed in fancier hotels while in NYC, but paying that extra money seems silly now when I could have stayed here and had basically the same experience. I even love it’s classic hotel feel of the lobby. Can’t wait to come back!', 'Over the decades,I\\'ve stayed at the Edison  on much-loved  \"theater-blitzes\". It was great being able to do so again recently this November, after Covid\\'s restrictions lifted. As a NY hometown girl, I\\'m used to, and not bothered by NYC staff being brusk -- it\\'s often part of life in this teeming  city.. So when a staff associate is especially helpful, it\\'s noteworthy. My appreciation goes to Mr. Luidin De Los Santos, the Director of the Front Office,  for his polite help in diagnosing and helping me fix my (now foreign) cellphone\\'s problems in accessing WiFi and Cellular. Thank you for adding to my  pleasurable stay at the hotel.', 'The Hotel Edison is such a great hotel!  We have been staying here for many years.  The staff is so very friendly and helpful. The rooms are always clean and the location is great, especially after Broadway shows, it is walkable distance from most of the theaters!    I would recommend this hotel to anyone!', 'Room was clean and adequate. very small, but included breakfast which was good (nothing fancy). Most of the front desk and staff (5 of 6) who we interacted with were not particularly helpful. My daughter had a clothing issue and needed a safety pin.  Front desk wanted to send it  (a safety pin?) to our room when we were obviously on the way to the theater and acted quite annoyed. So no sewing kit to be had and none to buy in shop. No fridge in room.', 'I had a great stay at Hotel Edison. The hotel is in a perfect location near Times Square and all the Broadway theatres. I especially appreciated the level of security provided by the hotel. In particular, the hotel staff verified that all people entering the elevators had a room key, which made me feel very safe. The hotel also provided a free breakfast. Thank you, Hotel Edison. I will definitely be back!', 'I have been staying at the Hotel Edison for almost 20 years on my annual visit to NYC.  I come for two things….Broadway shows and runs in Central Park.   The location is second to none and I have watched the renovations and changes throughout the years and I love that they keep the “old New York” vibe.  The Rum House has still got great live music and Friedman’s is great for a quick bite or a hearty breakfast.    Can’t wait to return in April!', 'We are so grateful that Hotel Edison was recommended by a friend. We loved the Art Deco flair and art. The convenience for attending Broadway shows could not have been better. Yummy breakfast included, too! What fun it was to go on the complimentary neighborhood walking tour offered by Streetwise New York/Triumph Tour with Sonia as our guide. I wish we could have done more of them - so interesting and informative. I highly recommend including this in your stay at The Edison.', '5/5! This Hotel is in a GREAT location! Staff was professional and friendly! Rooms are clean. There are 3 restaurants/bars located inside the hotel. We will be back!  We stayed  on the 16th floor. The only noise I heard was city noise. But hey —you are staying in a city that never sleeps!', 'A friend and I recently spent several days at the Hotel Edison. From the \"so glad to have you back\" check in to the effortless check out our visit was exactly what we needed after a long break from travel! The staff from housekeeping to restaurant workers was friendly and  helpful. Renovations since our last visit make the rooms more up to date while keeping the ambiance of the old Edison alive. The hotel\\'s location is perfect for seeing Broadway shows and subway stations are close by for venturing out.  A wide variety of restaurants and bars are within easy walking distance. We highly recommend the Hotel Edison!', 'Not only does the hotel have a very good location, but it is also comfortable and clean.  But what definitely made my stay pleasant was the attention provided by Justina, who was very attentive every day.  Thanks to her I want to return to that hotel.', \"This is the best place to Stay in Tmes square. They have multiple option of breakfast and we don't need to be in rush to have the breakfast. The Lady on reception desk named yustina is really kind, she explain to us nicely, and relay our order such as microwave and Fridge quickly. Thank you Yustina!\", 'Our visit to Edison hotel was fantastic. The room was beautiful and very clean. We also got breakfast in the morning at the Bond 45 in the lobby and it was delicious. Special thanks to Danny OBrien who made our special night unforgettable.', 'We stayed in the Edison Hotel for a night to enjoy the city! By the next day we decided to stay another night. But we struggled  a lot at the front desk to keep our previous night rate and room! Also we had a bad experience at breakfast for the lack of service! UNTIL DANNY THE SUPERVISOR SHOWED UP!!  Everything got solved in a minute!! always with a smile and willing to help! He even helped us book some Broadway tickets! That kind of attitude is contagious! His presence there truly MAKES THE DIFFERENCE!! If you stay there make sure to ask for Danny  he will make your day!!', 'I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in early November. It is excellently situated in the heart of Manhattan - at Times Square. The staff of this hotel is helpful as well as reliable and deserves the greatest recognition! All requests for amenities were granted. Special thanks to receptionist Justina for her exceptional kindness and helpfulness. Also, room service was of very good quality.Additional advantage of Hotel Edison is various and decent breakfast (3 venues available) included in price. Lastly, the price of stay is affordable considering such a great location, breakfast included and friendly staff. I will definitely come back to this hotel!', \"The Edison staff was helpful and professional.  Rooms were clean and although I wouldn't call them roomy, they were larger than most Manhattan hotels I have stayed.    Both restaurants -- Bond 45 and Friedman's -- have good food and drink.  Beds were comfortable and the bathroom was great with a very large shower.  Will definitely stay at the Edison when in Manhattan.\", 'The hotel is central to all theaters in Times Square. The room was clean, the white linens immaculate and there was daily maid service. We enjoyed the hot breakfast daily. The free Streetwise tours were amazing and we learned so much about the area. The staff was very friendly and helpful when we asked questions about transit options and discounted theater tickets. We will return on our next trip to the city.', 'I had a wonderful experience at the (Hotel Edison). Every staff member especially Justina from reception team who was very helpful, hospitable and there for every need of mine. Breakfast was awesome. Thank you so much! Will recommend to my colleagues!', 'Three of us stayed here for 5 nights in adjoining rooms (2 queens, 1 king), and thoroughly enjoyed our visit. Having breakfast available each morning was a bonus--we never ate in the restaurant, but got \"grab and go\" items and coffee each day, which was more than adequate (egg sandwiches, bagel, fruit cup, yogurt parfaits, etc.). The staff at the hotel was so helpful and responsive to my many requests: asked for a refrigerator in the room, needed an extra little table, had problems with wifi, and someone came to my room and worked with my laptop to get it going. As one knows, finding a hotel in NYC is an overwhelming task. I chose this one for its location and the positive reviews, and I was not disappointed. Prior to my stay, Mr. Holder helped me with numerous questions and requests, and this was greatly appreciated and influenced my decision in choosing the Edison. My single complaint was that the front desk was always busy (both checking in and checking out) with an unreasonably long wait. Perhaps one more staff person could ease this congestion.', 'Comfortable room, vouchers for breakfast. Easy walk to theaters and restaurants and Time Square.Staff friendly and helpful. Will assist with tours and theater tickets and airport transport.We loved the location. Our theater was an easy 5 minutes walk. We had dinner at Bond 45 restaurant right off the hotel lobby. Great Italian food with perfect NY cheesecake!']\n"
